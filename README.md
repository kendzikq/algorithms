# ALGORITHMS

The aim of this repository is to provide an insight about algorithms in general.<br/>
You will find here implementation of many popular problems.
<br/><br/>

##### Algorithms to be covered
- [X] Binary search
- [X] Selection sort
- [X] Quick sort: Lomuto partition scheme
- [ ] Quick sort: Hoare partition scheme
- [ ] Breadth-first search
- [ ] Dijkstra's algorithm
<br/>

##### Data structures to be covered
- [X] Stack
<br/>

##### Time Complexity

1. Binary search - O(log n)
2. Selection sort - O(n^2)
3. Quick sort - O(n log n)

The aim of this repository is to provide an insight about algorithms in general.<br/>
You will find here implementation of many popular problems.
<br/><br/>

##### Algorithms to be covered
- [X] Binary search
- [X] Selection sort
<br/>

##### Time Comlexity

1. Binary search - O(log n)
2. Selection sort - O(n^2)
